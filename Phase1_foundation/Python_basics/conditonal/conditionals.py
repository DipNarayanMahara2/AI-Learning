# Conditionals : Conditionals helps your progam to make decisions. You can execute defferent ode blocks depending whether certain condtions are true

# Syntax :
# if condtions_here :
  # code to run if condition is true
# elif another_condition_here :
  # code to run if another condition is true
# else :
  # if both if and elif condition is false then else will be executed
