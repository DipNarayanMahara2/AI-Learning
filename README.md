# Day 1: Python Programming Basics

Welcome to Day 1 of your AI Engineering Roadmap! Today, we focus on mastering the **fundamentals of Python programming**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand what **variables** are and how to store data in them
- Learn Python **data types**: integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- Practice using **input()** to receive user input
- Use **arithmetic operators** to perform calculations
- Write **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) for decision making
- Format output using **print()** and **f-strings**

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Variables and data types
- Taking input from users and converting data types
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Conditional logic and comparisons
- Output formatting with f-strings

## 📝 Project Overview

This repository includes the following practice programs:

1. **BMI Calculator**  
   Calculates Body Mass Index based on user input weight and height and outputs the health category.

2. **Simple Calculator**  
   Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /, %) based on user inputs.

3. **Temperature Converter**  
   Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

4. **Area of a Circle**  
   Calculates the area of a circle given the radius.

5. **Age in Days Calculator**  
   Calculates approximate age in days based on the year of birth.

6. **Swapping Values**  
   Demonstrates swapping two numbers without using a temporary variable.

# 💻 Day 2: Conditionals Practice — Python

## ✅ Topics Covered

Conditionals (if, elif, else)
Comparison operators (==, >, <, >=, <=, !=)
Logical operators (and, or, not)
Input/output formatting
Basic nested conditions

## 🧾 What We Practiced

### 🌟 Conditionals Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # runs if condition is true
elif another_condition:
    # runs if first is false, second is true
else:
    # runs if all above conditions are false
```

## ✅ Practice Questions

🟢 **Question 1**

Write a program that takes a number as input.
Print "Positive" if it is greater than zero.
Print "Zero" if it is exactly zero.
Print "Negative" if it is less than zero.

🟢 **Question 2**

Take a person's age as input.
Print "Child" if age ≤ 12.
Print "Teenager" if 13 ≤ age ≤ 19.
Print "Adult" if 20 ≤ age ≤ 59.
Print "Senior" if age ≥ 60.

🟢 **Question 3**

Ask the user to enter a year.
Check and print whether it is a leap year or not.
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

🟢 **Question 4**

Ask the user to input two numbers and print which one is larger, or if they are equal.

🟢 **Question 5**

Ask the user to enter a character.
Check whether it is a vowel or a consonant.
Hint: Check if character is in 'aeiouAEIOU'.

🟢 **Question 6**

Take a number as input.
Print "Even" if it is divisible by 2.
Else, print "Odd".

🟢 **Question 7**

Ask the user to enter a mark (0–100).
Print "Fail" if < 40.
Print "Pass" if 40–59.
Print "Good" if 60–79.
Print "Excellent" if 80–100.
Print "Invalid Marks" otherwise.

🟢 **Question 8**

Ask for the day number (1 to 7).
Print the corresponding day name (e.g., 1 = "Monday", 2 = "Tuesday", etc.).
Print "Invalid day number" if outside 1–7.

**🟢 Question 9**

Ask for a number.
Check and print whether it is a multiple of 5 or not.

🟢 **Question 10**

Input three numbers.
Print the largest of the three.
