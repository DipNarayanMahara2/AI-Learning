# Day 1: Python Programming Basics

Welcome to Day 1 of your AI Engineering Roadmap! Today, we focus on mastering the **fundamentals of Python programming**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand what **variables** are and how to store data in them
- Learn Python **data types**: integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- Practice using **input()** to receive user input
- Use **arithmetic operators** to perform calculations
- Write **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) for decision making
- Format output using **print()** and **f-strings**

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Variables and data types
- Taking input from users and converting data types
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Conditional logic and comparisons
- Output formatting with f-strings

## 📝 Project Overview

This repository includes the following practice programs:

1. **BMI Calculator**  
   Calculates Body Mass Index based on user input weight and height and outputs the health category.

2. **Simple Calculator**  
   Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /, %) based on user inputs.

3. **Temperature Converter**  
   Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

4. **Area of a Circle**  
   Calculates the area of a circle given the radius.

5. **Age in Days Calculator**  
   Calculates approximate age in days based on the year of birth.

6. **Swapping Values**  
   Demonstrates swapping two numbers without using a temporary variable.

# 💻 Day 2: Conditionals Practice — Python

## ✅ Topics Covered

Conditionals (if, elif, else)
Comparison operators (==, >, <, >=, <=, !=)
Logical operators (and, or, not)
Input/output formatting
Basic nested conditions

## 🧾 What We Practiced

### 🌟 Conditionals Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # runs if condition is true
elif another_condition:
    # runs if first is false, second is true
else:
    # runs if all above conditions are false
```

## ✅ Practice Questions

🟢 **Question 1**

Write a program that takes a number as input.
Print "Positive" if it is greater than zero.
Print "Zero" if it is exactly zero.
Print "Negative" if it is less than zero.

🟢 **Question 2**

Take a person's age as input.
Print "Child" if age ≤ 12.
Print "Teenager" if 13 ≤ age ≤ 19.
Print "Adult" if 20 ≤ age ≤ 59.
Print "Senior" if age ≥ 60.

🟢 **Question 3**

Ask the user to enter a year.
Check and print whether it is a leap year or not.
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

🟢 **Question 4**

Ask the user to input two numbers and print which one is larger, or if they are equal.

🟢 **Question 5**

Ask the user to enter a character.
Check whether it is a vowel or a consonant.
Hint: Check if character is in 'aeiouAEIOU'.

🟢 **Question 6**

Take a number as input.
Print "Even" if it is divisible by 2.
Else, print "Odd".

🟢 **Question 7**

Ask the user to enter a mark (0–100).
Print "Fail" if < 40.
Print "Pass" if 40–59.
Print "Good" if 60–79.
Print "Excellent" if 80–100.
Print "Invalid Marks" otherwise.

🟢 **Question 8**

Ask for the day number (1 to 7).
Print the corresponding day name (e.g., 1 = "Monday", 2 = "Tuesday", etc.).
Print "Invalid day number" if outside 1–7.

**🟢 Question 9**

Ask for a number.
Check and print whether it is a multiple of 5 or not.

🟢 **Question 10**

Input three numbers.
Print the largest of the three.

# Day 3: Loops & Patterns — Python

Welcome to Day 3 of your AI Engineering Roadmap! Today, we focus on mastering loops and creating patterns in Python.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand how to use while loops to repeat tasks based on conditions

Learn to use for loops to iterate over sequences

Practice automating repetitive tasks

Work with loops to solve problems and create patterns

Handle collections (lists, strings, etc.) using loops

**📚 Topics Covered**

1. while loops and their syntax
2. for loops with range() and sequences
3. Automating repetitive tasks
4. Reducing code duplication with loops

**Solving problems using loops**

# 📝 Project Overview

This repository includes practice programs to reinforce loop concepts:

1. **Print Numbers**
   Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.

2. **Even Numbers**
   Prints all even numbers from 1 to a user-defined number n.

3. **Sum of Numbers**
   Calculates and prints the sum of numbers from 1 to n.

4. **Factorial Calculator**
   Computes the factorial of a given number n.

5. **Multiplication Table**
   Prints the multiplication table for a number n (e.g., 5 × 1 to 5 × 10).

6. **Divisible by 3 and 5**
   Prints all numbers between 1 and 100 divisible by both 3 and 5.

7. **Reverse a Number**
   Reverses a given number (e.g., 123 → 321).

8. **Sum of Digits**
   Calculates the sum of digits of a given number.

9. **Count Digits**
   Counts the number of digits in a given number.

10. **Palindrome Check**
    Checks if a number is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
